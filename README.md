- - - -

This project provides abstractions for some plotting libraries (JFreeChart, JZY3D) and demo usages for finmath lib.
It is provided for convenience to test and explore finmath lib.

Main features:
- Create 2D and 3D graphs (using JFreeChart (2D) and JZY3D (3D)).
- Animated visualization (using JZY3D (which uses OpenGL)).
- Save the graphs as PDF (using iText).
- Easy to use classes and methods with a default style.
